## Idea
I want to create a random-ish blog for my own thoughts. Main page with post samples, historical
look up of posts, shareable links, about page, stuff like that, all on a public address. I want
the posts to be markdown formatted, to start, and formatted in-browser. Ideally, post history and
that information would be stored in DDB, rather than on the EC2 host itself on an on-the-box
SQLite database.

## Checklist
* ~~Public EC2 host and address~~
* HTML format of the site
* Main page
* About page
* History page
* Shareable links
* Uploadable images for posts
* Markdown format
* Data saved on DDB/S3
* Human-readable URL (launch)
